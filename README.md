##About

This is a prototype for the PBCR. Designed to be used on internal servers
to increase productivity and efficency within the various departments. 
With the current system information is distributed throughout multiple files and 
folders on a shared drive and disseminated through excel.

The goal of this project is to:  

1. Create a structured area that all information shared between departments is localized and stored in a central area.
2. Create an area where centralized data is not only refrencable and mutable. This is done by implementing features to:  
  - Create new tables as needed due to new events or a seperation of archival and current data.  
  - Tables will be mutable by original creater of the entry or supervisor.  
  - Table will be searchable by a variety of data central to each database
3. User restriction based on position and type of information and control nessesary to perform job duties
